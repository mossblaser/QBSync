QBSync: A synchronised video player for lonely hearts
=====================================================

QBSync (pronounced 'cubie sync') is a thrown-together web application which
allows two (or more) people to watch a HTML 5 video at the same time.

It was built to allow me and my wife to watch TV together while I am working
away from home while we use Skype (or similar) to chuckle along with whatever
we're watching. As a consequence, this software does not strive to achieve much
better than 100ms-or-so sync. Its primary goal, however, is to ensure that
controls are shared and that things like buffering etc. do not lead to players
drifting out of sync.
